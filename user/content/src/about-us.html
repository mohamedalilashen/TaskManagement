            <h3>Meet Cedar</h3>
            <p>
              The idea for OStation came to the co-founder after a harrowing
              personal journey through the space system that led to confusion,
              frustration and disappointment. One thing was clear: the system
              needed to change. Because when the user experience is convenient
              and clear, it leads to significantly better outcomes for service
              providers, payers and the people they serve. OStation's mission is
              to make spaceflight affordable and accessible through our
              consumer-friendly platform powered by data science, smart product
              design, and personalization.
